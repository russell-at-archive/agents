# Troubleshooting

## Common Mistakes


- **Solution before problem**: Writing feature descriptions before articulating
  the user problem. Fix: start with problem statement and user goals.
- **Vacuous requirements**: "Ensure compliance with best practices." Fix:
  cite the specific standard and the required outcome.
- **Missing evidence**: Stating a problem without data. Fix: cite the metric,
  support volume, or research finding.
- **Untestable criteria**: "The system should be responsive." Fix: "The system
  renders on screens 320px and wider without horizontal scroll."
- **Scope by omission**: Only listing what is in scope. Fix: explicitly list
  what is out of scope with reasons.
- **Static document**: PRD written once, never updated. Fix: update the
  changelog with every material change; keep status accurate.

## Red Flags


Stop and correct if:

- The PRD describes how to build something before defining what problem it
  solves
- Acceptance criteria contain words like "fast", "easy", "appropriate",
  "reasonable", or "etc."
- Success metrics lack baselines or target values
- Non-goals section is empty
- Risks section lists only value risk (ignoring usability, feasibility, and
  business viability)
- The document has not been updated since the initial draft despite ongoing
  discovery
