## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern       | Symptom                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Diff summary       | Summary restates what the diff shows |
| Missing link       | No `Closes` or `Refs` issue keyword  |
| Empty approach     | Approach is one vague sentence       |
| Fake alternatives  | Alternatives not genuinely weighed   |
| Unchecked DoD      | DoD boxes left unchecked             |
| Vague test plan    | "Ran tests, all passed"              |
| No reviewer steps  | How to Verify section is blank       |
| Wrong title format | Title not in Conventional Commits    |

## Common Mistakes

**Summarizing the diff instead of explaining the why.**
The reviewer can read the diff. The description must answer
"why was this change made this way?" If the summary sounds
like it was generated by `git diff --stat`, rewrite it.

**Skipping the Approach section for "obvious" changes.**
There is no such thing as an obvious change when reviewing
async. Even a one-line fix has a reason: write it. For
AI-generated PRs this section is the primary audit trail.

**Listing alternatives without rejecting them genuinely.**
"We considered X and Y" is not useful. "We rejected X
because it adds a Redis dependency we are not ready to
operate" is. Each rejected alternative needs a reason.

**Vague test plans.**
"Tests pass" is not a test plan. Include the exact commands
run, and the specific scenarios that were verified. A
reviewer should be able to reproduce the test plan without
reading the code.

**Missing issue link.**
Every PR must trace to a task. If there is no task issue,
create one before opening the PR. A PR without a task link
breaks the audit trail.

**Definition of done boxes left unchecked.**
If a box cannot be checked, the PR is not ready for review.
Surface the blocker as a comment rather than leaving
unchecked boxes and requesting review anyway.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask for clarification when:

- the task issue number is unknown
- the tests have not been run and results are unavailable
- the change touches areas outside the stated task scope
  (possible scope creep — surface it before writing the PR)
