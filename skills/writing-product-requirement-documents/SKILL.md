name: writing-porduct-requirement-documents
description: Use when creating or updating a Product Requirements Document,
  when a product feature or initiative needs a formal specification, or when
  asked to write a PRD. Produces complete, review-ready PRDs with measurable
  goals, testable acceptance criteria, and explicit scope boundaries.

# Writing Product Requirement Documents

## Overview

Produces a high-precision, AI-ready Product Requirements Document (PRD)
optimized for 2025-2026 development workflows. This skill focuses on
outcome-based goals, literal specificity for coding agents, and
maintaining a living document within the repository.

Full procedure: [references/overview.md](references/overview.md)

## When to Use

- Asked to "write a PRD", "create a spec", or "define a feature"
- Starting a new initiative that requires stakeholder alignment and
  engineering clarity
- Preparing context for AI coding agents (e.g., Cursor, Copilot) to
  implement a complex feature

## When Not to Use

- The request is for a technical design (use an RFC/Design Doc skill)
- The change is a small bug fix or trivial update
- Documenting architectural decisions (use an ADR skill)

## Prerequisites

- A clear "why" (the problem being solved)
- Identified target personas or user segments
- Basic understanding of desired outcomes or success metrics

## Workflow

1. **Context Gathering**: Define the problem statement and target
   audience. [references/overview.md#1-context-gathering](references/overview.md)
2. **Define Outcomes**: Establish measurable KPIs and success metrics.
   [references/overview.md#2-define-outcomes](references/overview.md)
3. **Specify Requirements**: Write INVEST-compliant user stories and
   functional requirements.
   [references/overview.md#3-specify-requirements](references/overview.md)
4. **AI Grounding**: Build an Entity Catalog and AI Context Block for
   coding agents.
   [references/overview.md#4-ai-grounding](references/overview.md)
5. **Establish Constraints**: Define Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs),
   scope, and risks.
   [references/overview.md#5-establish-constraints](references/overview.md)
6. **Refine & Validate**: Review against the checklist and finalize.
