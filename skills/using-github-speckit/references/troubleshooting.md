# Troubleshooting

## Red Flags


Stop and correct the workflow if any of these appear:

- Jumping from idea directly to `/tasks` without `/plan`
- Writing implementation code when only a spec or plan was requested
- Missing success criteria or acceptance criteria
- Multi-feature scope packed into one spec without clear boundaries
