## Document Template


A well-structured markdown document follows this pattern:

1. Start with a single H1 heading
2. Write prose wrapped at 80 characters
3. Surround headings, lists, code blocks, and tables
   with blank lines
4. Use reference-style links for long URLs
5. End file with a single newline
